## Probably a dumb idea

Reading about last week's [State Visit](https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/trump-hails-uk-special-relationship-he-revels-pomp-historic-state-visit-2025-09-17/) to the UK has re-surfaced a bad idea I had a while back, and better that I dump it here on a Friday afternoon than inflict it on unsuspecting people in conversation.

We should offer Donald Trump the newly-created post of **Constitutional Monarch of the United States**, modeled after other Constitutional monarchies. It's a position that gives him many of the things he actually wants: life tenure, prominent roles in [charity and the fine arts](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/kennedy-center-president-departs-after-trump-becomes-board-of-trustees-chair/3843347/), optional sinecure jobs for his [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megxit), a [broadcast platform](https://www.royal.uk/the-christmas-broadcast) for "a chronicle of global, national and personal events which have affected the Monarch and their audience," and the freedom to play golf as much as he wants without public criticism.

At the same time, it would remove him from [electoral/partisan](https://time.com/6982130/british-royal-family-vote-general-election-crown-politics/) politics, and spare him from trying to actually solve problems like inflation or our [crumbling infrastructure](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/politics/trump-infrastructure-week.html), instead being allowed to focus on updating us on the status of the new [State Ballroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_State_Ballroom).

And timing-wise, by making the offer before we even reach the 2026 midterms, it looks less like a reaction to "Will he run again in direct contravention of the 22nd Amendment? Or not-run but try to stay in office anyway?" speculation.[^1]

## Obstacles

### uh, The Constitution

While it's unambiguously true that [Article 1 Section 9](https://constitutioncenter.org/the-constitution/full-text) begins with "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States..." we *have* already been playing pretty fast and loose with the rest of that clause: "... And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under [the United States], shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."

So maybe we define "Constitutional Sovereign for Life" so it's technically not a Title of Nobility, or maybe we get some other "King, Prince, or foreign State" to grant the title and have Congress give their Consent (which shouldn't be a problem). In any case, I wouldn't bet on the Judicial branch being the one to intervene and quash the plan.

### The White House (the building, not the metonym)

Let me be candid here: I've visited, and it's kind of a mess. A warren of tiny offices, centuries of conflicting retrofits, the press room is a total dump. And yet, he'll probably want to keep living there (at least until the Ballroom is finished), and I think we should roll with that. Since all of the various Power Broker hotels, restaurants, offices, etc. are nearby, there will still be the trappings of fame around 1600 Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, there's a *huge* federally-owned parcel, inside the boundaries of DC, that's finally getting redeveloped. (Not the FBI Headquarters; if only.) The only problem is that they're attempting to give it away, along with billions of future tax dollars, to some rich guy who plans to use it to put on [10 to 12 events a year](https://www.fieldofschemes.com/2025/09/22/23165/how-does-the-commanders-stadium-deal-suck-let-defector-count-the-ways/). There are *so, so* many better uses for that land; adding "new hq for the Executive branch" to the list, while removing "lavishly-subsidized stadium" is feeding two birds with one scone.[^2]

### Interim leadership

Maybe we spin it as, "Nobody should ride on your coattails, we need a new election to deliver a mandate for the next President." And then we can switch the cadence of Presidential elections to 2026, 2030, 2034 etc., thereby putting another little note in the history book with his name on it. A quick skim didn't turn up any statute saying "And the Years of Presidential Elections shalt be Divisible Evenley by Foure," so the change is just one more unwritten norm to crash through, like the 1994 Winter Olympics.

Bonus: I've long been jealous of Parliamentary democracies that could call an election with a couple months' notice, sometimes unexpectedly soon ('snap') after the last one. This would be our chance! Throwing a wrench in the timeline Gavin Newsom has been meticulously maintaining for the last decade would be an added bonus.

### The "No Kings" movement / branding

I think we can keep #NoKings stuff around -- it would make it funnier if we gave Trump like an orb and scepter, while meanwhile the political system quietly moved on from its decade of vapor-lock without him. And then the protests are less abstract, more like the anti-royalists  they have in the UK, [Thailand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Thai_protests), or [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_Norway).

## But a good compromise?

I think we've seen enough evidence that Trump likes the parts of the job where he puts a medal on Sly Stallone or posts reactions to tv news he's watching, while he doesn't like the parts where he's expected to follow laws and rules or successfully manage a large organization that's working on complex challenges. So Constitutional Monarch, as long as we can frame it as "an unprecedented promotion," should keep him happy.

And while I assume the other 192 members of the UN General Assembly had an unpleasant time sitting through his keynote this week, I figure Trump had a bad time, too[^3] -- the contrast with his public Cabinet meetings couldn't be sharper.

I wouldn't go so far as to predict this will "solve" the deep, intractable problems in the US political system (which imho is gonna require one or more Amendments[^4]), but it would at least shake up the etch-a-sketch, maybe put some new possibilities on the table. (Or at least returning to some old ones, like USAID existing.)

In the long term, this could be a trial run -- definitely not suggesting CMotUS be a hereditary position -- but similar to, like, Time Magazine Person of the Year, People's Sexiest Man Alive, or Poet Laureate, this would give us precedent to name-and-fame someone who has captured America's attention... while putting them safely arm's-length away from any programs or institutions people actually rely on.

### Notes

[^1]:  Sparing us from that opinion-cycle of takes would be a blessing in itself.

[^2]: I'm aware that some pronounce it like 'scawn', but [even the UK](https://yougov.co.uk/society/articles/50339-the-scone-pronunciation-map-of-britain) is divided on the merits, don't @ me.

[^3]: Not even talking about the escalator thing, just the feelings engendered by delivering the speech itself.

[^4]: Which this plan would not, again assuming the Supreme Court doesn't discover a distaste for Emoluments.
